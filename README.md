# Simple C# Music Library

This C# app is aimed to help manage an online music library. 

By using the app, one can browse through the default songs the library contains, as well as edit them, delete them, add new songs and even export and import them through binary files.

The app also stores data about clients, such as name, age, and their favorite genre, all of which can be edited/deleted. Likewise, new clients can also be added.

Lastly, it also offers the possibility of recommending songs to a client by filtering all of the songs in the library so that only the ones whose genre matches the client's favourite are shown.
